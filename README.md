*****************


12 signs you have a toxic boss.

Spot them now - before it's too late:

The wrong manager will:
↳Make you question your value
↳Damage your physical AND mental health
↳Hold back your growth


If these signs feel all too familiar:

Know that it's not your fault,
But it IS your signal to start planning a way out.

1) Takes the Credit
↳Owns the wins but passes blame for failures
↳Ex: Presents your idea as theirs, then blames you if it flops

2) Breaks Commitments
↳Says what sounds good, but doesn't follow through
↳Ex: Promises raises or promotions that never come

3) Rules with Fear
↳Relies on intimidation, not inspiration
↳Ex: Team avoids speaking up out of fear of backlash

4) Hides the Truth
↳Keeps employees in the dark, causing confusion
↳Ex: Announces big changes with no notice or input

5) Controls Every Move
↳Micromanages, not trusting the team to work independently
↳Ex: Reviews every email and questions small decisions

6) Twists Reality
↳Makes people doubt their memory or judgment
↳Ex: Denies saying things that are documented

7) Rejects Feedback
↳Shuts down anyone who speaks honestly
↳Ex: Mocks or punishes employees who challenge bad ideas

8) Pushes Past Limits
↳Expects nonstop work with no regard for well-being
↳Ex: Sends late-night messages and expects instant replies

9) Favors Loyalty Over Skill
↳Rewards yes-people instead of strong performers
↳Ex: Promotes someone less qualified who always agrees

10) Shows No Empathy
↳Sees people as output machines, not humans
↳Ex: Ignores emergencies and expects people to "tough it out"

11) Avoids Accountability
↳Disappears when leadership is most needed
↳Ex: Leaves the team guessing when problems arise

12) Drains the Room
↳Creates a tense, exhausting atmosphere
↳Ex: Constant criticism that kills motivation and energy

No job is worth sacrificing your health or confidence.

If you're dealing with any of these,

Trust yourself - 
And start looking for the exit.

Have you worked with someone like this before?

***********************

55% of leadership perception is pure body language.

Words? Just 7%. The brutal truth:

Before you open your mouth, people have already decided:

• If they trust you
• If they'll follow you
• If you're worth their time
• If you belong in the room

I've watched brilliant executives lose deals because they fidgeted.

And average presenters win millions because they learned to appear confident.

Here's what your body is telling people right now:

Hidden hands = Hidden agenda
↳ Pockets, behind back, under table
↳ Triggers instant distrust
↳ Fix: Keep hands visible, gesture naturally

Darting eyes = Weak conviction
↳ Scanning the room, avoiding contact
↳ Signals insecurity or deception
↳ Fix: Hold eye contact 3-5 seconds per person

Slouched shoulders = Low status
↳ Hunched, leaning, protective posture
↳ Screams "I don't belong here"
↳ Fix: Stand tall, shoulders back, own your space

Master these 3 moves this week:

1. The Power Reset (10 seconds)
Before walking into any meeting:
Stand tall, breathe deep, shoulders back.
Reset your presence at the door.

2. The Trust Triangle
Hands visible + eye contact + open posture.
Hit all three. Watch barriers drop.

3. The Stillness Test
When stakes are high, movement is weakness.
Plant your feet. Slow your gestures. Let silence work.

Your competitors are learning this.
Your team is watching for it.
Your success depends on it.

Because here's what nobody tells you:

People don't follow ideas.
They follow presence.

And presence isn't personality.
It's a skill you can master.

Starting now.

****

I’ve hired 100+ top performers — and here’s what they all have in common:

↳ It’s not the perfect СV.
↳ Not the fanciest degree.
↳ Not even years of experience.

It’s how they think, act, and communicate in the interview.

Learn how to enroll for free:
https://lnkd.in/dqKyzitS


Here are 9 interview questions you will be asked: 
(and how to actually win them)

1. What’s your greatest weakness?

🚫 Don’t give cliché answers.
✅ Share how you actively work on your weaknesses.

2. Why do you want to work here?

🚫 Don’t talk about perks 
✅ Speak about growth, impact, and alignment with the mission

3. Tell me about yourself.

🚫 Don’t list hobbies or general facts 
✅ Highlight who you are professionally and what results you’ve delivered

4. Why did you leave your last job?

🚫 Avoid blaming or drama 
✅ Focus on what you're seeking next (growth, challenge, direction)

5. How do you handle stress?

🚫 “I just push through” won’t cut it 
✅ Show how you manage pressure with real strategies and tools

6. Tell me about a time you failed.

🚫 Don’t say “I don’t fail” 
✅ Be honest — and show what you learned

7. How do you handle conflict at work?

🚫 “I avoid it” = red flag 
✅ Show you value open, respectful communication

8. Why should we hire you?

🚫 Don’t just say “I work hard” 
✅ Prove it with skills + specific examples of impact

9. Tell me about a time you led a team.

🚫 Don’t say “I just told people what to do” 
✅ Show how you aligned, delegated, and motivated

Interviews aren’t exams. 
They’re your chance to tell your story — clearly and confidently.

↳ Be honest.
↳ Be specific.
↳ Show how you’ve grown.

What’s the hardest interview question you’ve ever been asked?

🔁 Share this with someone who needs to hear it.
