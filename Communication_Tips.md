The 5 levels of communicating your impact as an engineer in tech:

Level 1: What you did
Migrated the user authentication system to OAuth 2.0

Level 2: Had impact
...which reduced login failures

Level 3: Specific impact
...by 40% (from 15% to 9%)

Level 4: Tied to a goal
...exceeded our Q2 reliability target by 2x

Level 5: and dollars or top-level business metrics
...and prevented $2.1M in annual revenue loss and saved 15 hours/week in support

If you can include all of these in your self-reviews or resume, it's the strongest impact you can communicate. Still, reaching Level 5 is hard. You might not have all the data to get there, so Level 3-4 is ok too. The key is being as specific as possible with the data you have.
